# Spring Data Web Application

## Acknowledgements

This is adapted from a [LEAN**STACKS**](http://www.leanstacks.com) solution.

## Languages

This project is authored in Java.

## Installation

### Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies be installed on the host machine:

* Java Development Kit 8 or later
* Apache Maven 3 or later

## Running

The project uses [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) for build, package, and test workflow automation.  The following Maven goals are the most commonly used.

### spring-boot:run

The `spring-boot:run` Maven goal performs the following workflow steps:

* compiles Java classes to the /target directory
* copies all resources to the /target directory
* starts an embedded Apache Tomcat server

To execute the `spring-boot:run` Maven goal, type the following command at a terminal prompt in the project base directory.

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Type `ctrl-C` to halt the web server.

This goal is used for local machine development and functional testing.  Use the `package` goal for server deployment.

### test

The `test` Maven goal performs the following workflow steps:

* compiles Java classes to the /target directory
* copies all resources to the /target directory
* executes the unit test suites
* produces unit test reports

The `test` Maven goal is designed to allow engineers the means to run the unit test suites against the main source code.  This goal may also be used on continuous integration servers such as Jenkins, etc.

To execute the `test` Maven goal, type the following command at a terminal prompt in the project base directory.

```
mvn clean test
```

### package

The `package` Maven goal performs the following workflow steps:

* compiles Java classes to the /target directory
* copies all resources to the /target directory
* executes the unit test suites
* produces unit test reports
* prepares an executable JAR file in the /target directory

The `package` Maven goal is designed to prepare the application for distribution to server environments.  The application and all dependencies are packaged into a single, executable JAR file.

To execute the `package` goal, type the following command at a terminal prompt in the project base directory.

```
mvn clean package
```

The application distribution artifact is placed in the /target directory and is named using the `artifactId` and `version` from the pom.xml file.  To run the JAR file use the following command:

```
java -jar example-1.0.0.jar
```

By default, the batch and hsqldb profiles are active.  To run the application with a specific set of active profiles, supply the `--spring.profiles.active` command line argument.  For example, to start the project using MySQL instad of HSQLDB and enable the batch process:

```
java -jar example-1.0.0.jar --spring.profiles.active=mysql,batch
```
